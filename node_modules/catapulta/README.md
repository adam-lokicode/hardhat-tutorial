Check below for quick documentations for:

- Foundry
- Hardhat Deploy

### Requirements

For using Catapulta, you need to register at [Catapulta.sh](https://catapulta.sh), and create a project to obtain your API key.

### Foundry: Getting started

To be able to deploy using Catapulta, you need to specify the Foundry Script path, the chain to perform the deployment and the Catapulta API Key:

```
  npx catapulta script scripts/DeployBasic.s.sol --chain 11155111  --api-key <your-api-key>
```

You can pass any extra `forge script` params at the end of the command, like `--with-gas-price` or `--private-key`.

```
  npx catapulta script scripts/Ghost.s.sol --chain 11155111  --api-key <your-api-key> --with-gas-price 10000000000
```

If you want to see full documentation, you can run:

```
npx catapulta --help
```

To remove the need to pass `--api-key` in every command, you can also add `CATAPULTA_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file.

### Hardhat: Getting Started

If you use Hardhat Deploy, you may need to install and import the Catapulta plugin in your hardhat.config.ts file.

```
npm i --save-dev catapulta
```

Them proceed to import the Catapulta plugin in your hardhat.config.ts file:

```
// hardhat.config.ts
// Include the Catapulta Hardhat plugin at the top of your config

import 'catapulta/hardhat';
```

Run your Hardhat deploy scripts using Catapulta CLI. You can pass any extra parameter needed for `hardhat deploy`.

```
npx catapulta deploy --network sepolia --api-key <your-api-key>
```
